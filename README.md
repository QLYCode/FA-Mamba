# Frequency-Aware Mamba: Exploiting Frequency-Domain Priors to Alleviate Class Imbalance in Medical Image Segmentation

#### [ðŸ“Œ] The paper is currently under review (not yet published), and the source code will be released only after official acceptance.

This repository is the official implementation of the paper SPC-Seg
## Datasets

### DDTI
For DDTI, which is challenging due to low contrast and ambiguous boundaries, we use five-fold cross-validation with mutually exclusive folds for training and validation. 

### TN3K
For TN3K, which exhibits large nodule-scale variation and class imbalance: 2,303 images for training, 576 for validation, and 614 for testing. All experiments adopt 5-fold cross-validation. Performance is evaluated by Accuracy, Dice, IoU, FLOPs, and Params.
